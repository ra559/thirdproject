<h1> About Me</h1>
<img class="img-responsive img-rounded gif" src="../assets/me.png">
<p>My name is Robert Alberto. I am from the Dominican Republic and came to live in the USA in Dec 2013.
    In the Dominican Republic, I used to work in the Hospitality business and when I emigrated to the USA I worked in
    the retail industry. I work for a software company in New York City as a Technical Support Representative and I
    am also a small business owner who specializes in providing IT solutions to small businesses and individuals.
    As a career goal, I want to be a DevOps Engineer and eventually grow my business to a point where I do not need to
    be employed but be an employer instead.</p>
<p> Shortly after arriving in the USA, I decided to go to college and major in IT. I went to Passaic County
    Community College where I obtained a Networking Administration Associates degree. After completion, I transferred
    to NJIT where I completed a BS in Engineering Technology with a concentration in IT. Without losing time,
    I enrolled in the Master’s program for IT Administration & Security. I am interested in all the technologies
    that surround the DevOps philosophy therefore I am cloud-oriented and a big Linux enthusiast (let’s Automate the world!).
</p>
<p>For relaxation and hobbies, I read, play videogames, do exercise, play with my Raspberry Pi, learn new technologies,
    and hang out with my family (mostly to go buy books or eat). For reading, I enjoy a menage of topics that includes,
    but are not limited to, horror, classic literature, sci-fi, AI, history, and more.
</p>
