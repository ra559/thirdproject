<h2 id="domain-names">Domain Names</h2>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) provides a service to map human-readable names to IP addresses. For example. www.google.com to 172.217.165.142. DNS operates in a client-server model where a computer is a client when it requests the IP of a given name and as a client when it serves the IP of such name. Each name consists of a sequence of alpha-numeric segments separated by periods. Domain names are hierarchical with every part separated by a period representing a part of that hierarchy. For example:</p>

<h2 id="icann">ICANN</h2>
<p>The Domain Name System does not specify the value for the Top Level Domain. TLDs are controlled by an organization called Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is an American nonprofit organization responsible for the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network’s stable and secure operation. Much of its work has concerned the Internet’s global Domain Name System (DNS), including policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level domains (TLDs), and the operation of root name servers.<br />
ICANN’s creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998, and it formally came into being on September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California. Originally headquartered in Marina del Rey in the same building as the University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute (ISI), its offices are now in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los A ngeles in Facebook’s old office.</p>

<h2 id="top-level-domains">Top Level Domains</h2>
<p>When a company applies for a name under one of the existing top-level domains and the name is awarded, the domain name gets registered with the company and other companies cannot register the same domain (unless the registration expires). For example, company A registered the domain the3rdproject.com, other companies cannot register the same .com domain but they can register .org or .xyz if available.</p>

<p>Many organizations assign domain names that reflect the role a computer in a given network performs. For example, a file server in the3rdproject organization may be named: ftp.the3rdproject.com. FTP indicates that that computer is running the file transfer protocol. However, using the first label in a domain name to denote a service is merely a convention to help humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-dns-really-work">How does DNS really work?</h2>
<h3 id="the-dns-hierarchy">The DNS hierarchy</h3>
<p>DNS is an autonomous system which means that each organization is free to assign names to computers or change them without notifying any authority. This is possible because each organization is allowed to have DNS servers as part of its hierarchy. In the case of the3rdproject, their DNS handles domains ending in the3rdproject.com. This means that their DNS knows the location (ip address) of mail.the3rdproject.com, ftp.the3rdproject.com, server.the3rdproject.com, etc.<br />
Another ability of the DNS system is that administrators can replicate DNS servers to provide fault tolerance in environments where DNS servers are heavily used.</p>
<h3 id="name-resolution">Name resolution</h3>
<p>Name resolution is the conversion of a domain name to an IP address. The software that performs this conversion is the name resolver. Each resolver is configured with the address of one or more local domain name servers. The resolver forms a DNS request message, sends the message to the local server, and waits for the server to send a DNS reply message that contains the answer. <img src="../assets/dnsresolver.gif" alt="DNS resolver in action" /></p>
